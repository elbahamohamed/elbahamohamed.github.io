I design and deliver applied AI systems that work in the real world. With expertise spanning the full lifecycle — from defining needs to modeling, deployment, and adoption — I build solutions that are both technically robust and operationally viable.

I hold a Master of Engineering from [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en) in France and a Bachelor’s in Pure Mathematics from the [University of Western Brittany](https://www.univ-brest.fr/fr). My work blends deep mathematical grounding with pragmatic engineering.

I’m also the founder of [MAIR](https://mair.ma) (Moroccans in AI Research), a global network driving collaboration, mentorship, and visibility for Moroccan AI talent worldwide.
